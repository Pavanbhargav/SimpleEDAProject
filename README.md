# EDA of IT Jobs: Insights and Visualizations  

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview  
This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of IT jobs to uncover trends and insights about the industry. The dataset includes key information such as:  
- **Domain**: The area of expertise or specialization within IT.  
- **Job Title**: Specific roles in the IT industry.  
- **Projected Growth by 2030**: Expected growth rates for different roles by 2030, reflecting industry trends.  

The analysis focuses on handling missing data, preprocessing the dataset, and creating insightful visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

## ðŸ›  Features  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled missing values (NaN).  
   - Ensured data consistency for meaningful analysis.  
   
2. **Visualizations**:  
   - Created a **treemap** using **Seaborn** to depict the distribution of job domains and their growth rates.  
   - Plotted trends in job roles and domain popularity using bar charts and other visualizations.  

3. **Key Insights**:  
   - Identified top-growing IT domains and roles by 2030.  
   - Analyzed the relationship between domains and growth rates.
